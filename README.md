# CB-Pokemon
This started out as a fork of the Pokemon Bot of asudem.
I was bored on a Sunday and decided to take this, completely port it over to Typescript (another programming language) and extend it bit by bit.
Right now, you don't have any features you get beyond the original version on asudem, you might even have more bugs since this one is not tested ^^. But since this is Typescript I guess it'll be quicker to add features to it and still have a good program over all.
