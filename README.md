# CB's #1 Pokemon Bot

This started out as a fork of the [Pokedex Bot](https://de.chaturbate.com/apps/app_details/pokedex/?version=&slot=3) of [asudem](https://de.chaturbate.com/apps/user_uploads/3/asudem/).
I was bored on a Sunday and decided to take this, completely port it over to Typescript (another programming language) and extend it bit by bit.
The code is public, feel free to check it out, copy it and make your own version. But please let the dev (me) and original author (asudem) stay in there as legacy or link us somewhere at least: https://github.com/thamo01/CB-Pokemon
